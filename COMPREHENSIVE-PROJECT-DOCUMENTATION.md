- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with staging/production workflow

### Domain-Driven Design Structure

The platform is organized into six bounded contexts:

1. **Client Management** - Multi-tenant foundation
2. **Product Management** - Amazon product catalog
3. **Financial Analytics** - Profit calculations
4. **Forecasting** - Predictive analytics
5. **Marketplace Integration** - Amazon API connections
6. **Export & Reporting** - Data export services

### Multi-Tenant Architecture

**Tenant Isolation Strategy**
- Row-level security in PostgreSQL
- Client ID filtering at repository layer
- JWT tokens contain tenant context
- Separate Amazon credentials per client/marketplace

**Subscription Tiers**
- **BASIC**: 1 Amazon account, 2 users, CSV exports
- **PREMIUM**: 5 Amazon accounts, 10 users, Excel exports, forecasting
- **ENTERPRISE**: Unlimited accounts/users, PDF exports, priority support

## üîê Security Implementation

### Authentication & Authorization

**Hybrid Authentication Model**
1. **Firebase Authentication** for user identity management
2. **Custom JWT tokens** for Amazon-specific permissions
3. **Demo mode** for testing without Firebase
4. **Google OAuth** integration

**Security Features**
- RS256 signature validation only
- Algorithm confusion prevention
- Token expiry validation
- Cross-tenant access prevention
- Injection attack protection (SQL, XSS, Command)
- Real-time SIEM alerting for suspicious activities

### Test Coverage & Quality

**Test Statistics**
- Total Tests: 299 across 21 test suites
- Success Rate: 100%
- Security Vulnerabilities: 0 detected
- Attack Detection: 100% success rate

**Security Test Scenarios**
- JWT tampering detection
- Cross-tenant data access attempts
- SQL injection in client IDs
- XSS attack vectors
- Path traversal attempts
- DoS protection validation

## üîó Amazon SP-API Integration

### Current Implementation Status

**Completed Services**
1. **Orders API v0** ‚úÖ
   - Full sandbox support with TEST_CASE_200
   - Order retrieval and details
   - Time-based order queries

2. **Catalog API v2022-04-01** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Complete implementation
   - Limited to static sandbox data
   - Product search and detail retrieval

3. **Reports API v2021-06-30** ‚ùå
   - Full implementation complete
   - NOT available in sandbox
   - Requires production credentials

4. **Finances API v2024-06-19** ‚ùå
   - Complete implementation
