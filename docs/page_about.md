## About the Founder

### Serhii Yaremenko, Ph.D.

I bring a unique combination of academic rigor and operational excellence to DLV Insight. With a Ph.D. in Computer Science specializing in Cybernetics, I apply systems thinking and mathematical precision to solve complex e-commerce challenges.

**My E-commerce Journey**
- **Current**: CEO of MSVenturesGroup, an 8-figure e-commerce operation (€10M+ annual revenue)
- **Track Record**: Scaled the business by 25% YoY through systematic operational improvements
- **Global Experience**: 8+ years managing operations across 16 Amazon marketplaces in 15 countries
- **Cumulative Impact**: €29M+ in total sales managed across various ventures

**Why I'm Building DLV Insight**

Having scaled my own e-commerce operations to 8 figures, I experienced firsthand the gap between having data and making strategic decisions. Every day, I faced the challenge of transforming endless reports into actionable strategies while managing €10M+ in annual revenue.

DLV Insight is built from the trenches - it's the tool I wished existed when trying to answer critical questions like:
- "What's my true profit after all costs?"
- "Which products should I discontinue?"
- "How much inventory should I order for Q4?"
- "What's the real LTV of my customers?"

This isn't just another dashboard. It's a strategic co-pilot for ambitious sellers who've outgrown basic reporting tools.

## Vision for DLV Insight

### The Problem We're Solving
Amazon sellers are drowning in data but starving for insights. Current tools provide endless reports but fail to answer the critical question: "What should I do next?" 

### Our Solution
We're building advanced analytics that Fortune 500 companies use, but making it accessible for growing e-commerce brands:
- **Plan vs Fact P&L Analysis**: Track performance against strategic plans in real-time
- **LTV Cohort Analytics**: Understand true customer value across products and markets
- **AI-Powered Forecasting**: Predict inventory needs, cash flow, and growth opportunities
- **Strategic Decision Support**: Transform data into clear, actionable recommendations

### Our Mission
To empower e-commerce businesses with the same level of strategic clarity that I've used to scale to €10M+, making advanced analytics accessible and actionable for every ambitious seller.

## Core Philosophy

**"Honesty and Mathematical Exactness"**

This isn't just a tagline - it's how I approach both business and product development:
- **Honesty**: Radical transparency about what works and what doesn't in e-commerce
- **Mathematical Exactness**: Every feature is built with data accuracy and reliability at its core
- **Systems Thinking**: Viewing e-commerce as an interconnected system, not isolated metrics
- **Practical Application**: Theory is worthless without real-world results
